      This program written in MASM x86 implements concepts related to string primitive instructions 
      and Macros by getting ten signed integers from the user as strings, converting those strings to integers,
      calculating their sum and truncated average, and finally converting back into strings and printing the array 
      of integers and the results. 
      
      It does this all without using ReadInt, ReadDec, WriteInt, or WriteDec. 
      All print operations are carried out by a custom macro called mDisplayString.
