# Overview
This x86 Assembly program demonstrates advanced concepts related to string primitive instructions and Macros. The program receives ten signed integers as strings from the user, converts them to integers, calculates their sum and truncated average, and finally converts the results back into strings. Importantly, the program achieves this without utilizing standard instructions like ReadInt, ReadDec, WriteInt, or WriteDec. All print operations are carried out by a custom macro named mDisplayString.

# Features
**String to Integer Conversion:** The program efficiently converts user-inputted string representations of signed integers into their corresponding integer values.

**Arithmetic Operations:** Implements arithmetic operations to calculate the sum and truncated average of the provided integers.

**String Conversion:** Successfully converts the calculated results back into string format for display.

**Custom Macro - mDisplayString:** All print operations are performed using a custom macro, demonstrating the use of Macros for code modularity.
